Secretary
=========

IRC network administrators are often tasked with administrating multiple services that span entire servers. Unfortunately, this means that many routine tasks require the same effort to be applied again and again.

While custom scripts can ease this administation burden, there's often no failsafe or check to make sure they worked properly. And, as the network grows, the scripts often have to be edited again and again, allowing older and newer runs of the same script to cause potential inconsistencies between nodes.

Even worse, as the infrastructure of a network grows even more complicated, so do the training requirements for new administrators. With every added bit of complexity, the risks increase that a portion of the network will only be able to be effectively managed by a small number of users. A big danger when an emergency arises!

Enter __Secretary__.
